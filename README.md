# 42 Piscine

</div>

What the piscine teaches you is the following:

- Vim or Visual Studio Code (depending on which one you use)
- iTerm
- GitHub
- Using an iMac well =)
- Discord
- Stack Overflow 

and more below üîª

## Skills Developed at The Piscine

### Hard-Skills üíª
	# C Language
		The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
		pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
		including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

	# Shell
		The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
		shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

	# Git
		All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
		be at ease with such a system.

### Soft-Skills üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë
	# Self-Learning and Proactiveness
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-5 member group randomly
		chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
		common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

	# Time Management and Resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
		they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
		"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 28-day program.

and so many soft skills!

# Feeling Stuck?

**Feel stuck on a question?** </br>
Do either or all of the following:

- Ask anyone and everyone and show them what's happening.
- Check the Discord by either typing your problem in the right channel or searching the whole server in the top right corner of the Discord application. 
- Google Search the specific problem.
- Check out specific sites like GitHub and Stack Overflow. 

# Best Desktop Setup
Recommend best setup you should have on your desktop when you are on 42 Campus:

- 1st FireFox Browser Window (42 Intra, Discord & Nuclino Tabs)
- 2nd Browser Window (To Research The Project & any GitHub Tabs) 
- 1st iTerm Window (To do your C Project in)
- 2nd iTerm Window (For Normintette and Compiling the C Project)

# 42 C Projects

</div>

All C projects at 42 require you to have a header on-top of your .c file.

To create this header, you can do either of the following:

- In the .c file, type in ```:Stdheader``` or use the keyboard commands ```FN``` + ```ESC``` + ```F1```

## C Libraries üìö

This Github Repo uses only 3 C System Standard Libraries:

:one: ```#include <unistd.h>``` - for the ```write``` function.  <br>

:two: ```#include <stdio.h>``` - for the ```printf``` function. <br>

:three: ```#include <stdlib.h>``` - for the ```NULL``` function.

## ASCII Table üî°

When looking for characters and symbols in C, you can use decimals to locate them in your .c program/function.

![unknown](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82299698/152664282-eb24f09b-4061-470b-8269-47b56efc8682.png)

## Write ‚úçÔ∏è

write(1, &c, 1);

### write(``1`` <br>

Write takes the fd (file descriptor) which is either:

- 0 for stdin (standard input)
- 1 for stdout (standard output) - in the Piscine, you will always use 1.
- 2 for stderr (standard error)

### write(1, ``&c``

The middle part of write is what it will print out.

### write(1, &c, ``1``);

The third part of write is how many spaces of what your printing will take up. <br>

## C Data Types

<img width="494" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58959408/155830093-237cb2ff-ee08-4657-aa1d-b1136beac2f5.png">

## Int Main üíª

int   main(void)

### ``int main``

We use int main to compile our C projects.

### int main(```void```)

We use void because we are not taking any arguments, meaning we are not writing directly in the command line, but rather printing our .c program.

## Comments üóíÔ∏è

In C, you can comment in your code if you want to leave any notes/information in the code. The program/function will skip over your notes and not
run it when it complies. <br>

To comment your code, you can do either of the following: <br>

`// <your comment>` - double stroke (//) is for commenting single lines. <br>
`/* <your comment> */` - (/* */) is for commenting multiple lines. 

## GCC üìü

To compile your program/function, be in the folder of your program/function and type in the following:

- ```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror 'filename.c'```

then type the following if its a function (e.g. ft_putchar.c):

- ```./a.out``` 

or type the following if its a program (e.g. int	main(int argc, char **argv)):

- ```./a.out 'str1' 'str2'```

### How To Login Into The Exam

### Step :one: 
```
    login -> exam
    password -> exam
```

<br>

### Step :two:

‚å®Ô∏è Type ``examshell`` in terminal.

<br>

### Step :three:

    login -> your 42 intra username (eg. prossi)
    pasword -> your password

<br>

In the  examshell, you have only the following 3 commands:

1. ```status``` - See How Long You Have Left

2. ```grademe``` - Grade Your Project

3. ```finish``` - Stop Exam

<br>  

Open new terminal
```
    You can find your exam subject in the directory subject
    Then you can see directory Rendu. It is your repository.
    You must create the directory named by the project, create .c and/or .h and start working.
```

<br>

When you are ready to submit, go into /rendu and push the directory by doing the following:
```
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "done"
3. git push
4. After the git push, type `grademe`
```
